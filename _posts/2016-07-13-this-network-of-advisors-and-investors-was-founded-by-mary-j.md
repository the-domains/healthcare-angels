We have invested in a number of healthcare start-ups as a long term investor.

Our network has worked with the leading innovative organizations in the industry, Including Kaiser, Partners, Trinity Health, and Sutter, as well as some of the leading payers and physician groups. Many of these are likely to be strategic investors for the entrepreneurial ventures, facilitating the testing of concepts and real world applications in optimum settings.

# As An Investor

Whether you are investing individually, with others, or as part of a corporate venture/development group, you will have experienced the challenge of identifying those ideas most likely to be sustainable as well as timely in the market. Only 10% of startups produce 90% of the success. As your trusted advisors, we will cull from the hundreds of opportunities those credible enough for consideration. We will also match opportunities that make sense not only to you financially but also strategically. Again, because the healthcare sector is so complex, many new ideas and companies do not succeed because they are not close enough to the "real world" of healthcare delivery. This risk is reduced by combining financial and strategic investors.

After connecting you to these entrepreneurs via webinars, local gatherings, and remote hosting experiences, we will advise as needed on all elements of the transaction. Our partners have legal, financial, organizational, and content expertise. Our focus is on technology enabled products and services that have proven concepts, address the demands of the acute, outpatient, post-acute and retail delivery environments, initial revenue and are in need of resources to scale for growth.

Research has shown that those investors who do substantive due diligence, have domain expertise, and stay involved with their investments, produce the best results. This will be Healthcare Angels' unique approach to investing and advising.

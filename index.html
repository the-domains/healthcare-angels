We will also match opportunities that make sense not only to you financially but also strategically.

With over 40% of angel and VC investing in healthcare happening here, we recognized it was time to extend these opportunities throughout the world. Culling these opportunities using investor portals, syndicates, incubators, accelerators, and other angel groups, we reduce risk and increase speed to market for all parties. Our focus is on companies that provide technology-enabled products and services most likely to significantly impact the cost, access, and quality of healthcare globally. Our criteria for success is that more of the organizations we support will be succeeding five years from now than any of their counterparts.
